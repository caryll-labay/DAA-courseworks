# Randomized Algorithms Assignment

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to implement three algorithms using the Monte Carlo method and randomization techniques.

## Practice Problems
1. Estimation of PI with 1000 points
   - Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, estimate the value of $\pi$ with 1000 randomly generated points.
2. Estimation of area bounded by p1 and p2 using proportion for parabolas
   -  Suppose we have two points $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, where $x_1 < x_2$. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm and the proportion of points that fall under the parabola $y = x^2$ between $p_1$ and $p_2$, estimate the area bounded by the parabola and the x-axis between $p_1$ and $p_2$.
3. Estimation of volume of an ellipsoid
   - Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, estimate the volume of the ellipsoid $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} \leq 1$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the radii of the ellipsoid.

## Instructions
1. Create a Python script that implements the Monte Carlo method to solve the above practice problems.
2. Make sure your code is properly commented and understandable.
3. Add your implementation to the right file.
4. Test your implementation and ensure that it works correctly.
5. Submit your implementation by pushing your code to this repository
