# Huffman Coding Algorithm Challenge

Your task is to implement the Huffman coding algorithm in Python. The implementation should include two functions: compress and decompress.

# Input and Output
The input to the compress function should be the path to the input file, while the output should be the path to the compressed output file. The input to the decompress function should be the path to the compressed input file, while the output should be the path to the decompressed output file.

# Requirements
Your implementation should meet the following requirements:
- The input and output files should be in plain text format.
- The compressed output file should have the smallest size possible.
- The decompressed output file should be identical to the original input file.
- The code should be well-structured, easy to read, and commented.

#Scoring
The score for this challenge will be based on the compression ratio achieved by your implementation, i.e., the ratio between the size of the input file and the size of the compressed output file. The higher the compression ratio, the better the score.
